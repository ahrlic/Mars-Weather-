# Mars-Weather

Displays meaningful Nasa API data and displays graphs using Panadas and Matplotlib libraries in python

Set up instructions: 
1. run "pip install pandas" in the terminal
2. run "pip install requests" in the terminal
3. The demo key in place for the API Key has a rate limit, error code 429 refers to the limit being exceeded -> create your own API key here: https://api.nasa.gov/ 
   or wait some time before running the program again

This is a small personal project Im currently working on to work with python more, it is not inheriently finished, and will change
