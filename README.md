Set up instructions: 
1. run "pip install pandas" in the terminal
2. run "pip install requests" in the terminal
3. run "pip install matplotlib" in the terminal
4. The demo key in place for the API Key has a rate limit, error code 429 refers to the limit being exceeded -> create your own API key here: https://api.nasa.gov/ 
   or wait some time before running the program again
